You’ll learn the AMP way of doing all the most commonly required tasks, including coding HTML, writing CSS, adding images, integrating web fonts, embedding YouTube videos, using iframes, displaying image galleries, embedding tweets and generating carousels.

When you complete this course you’ll be equipped to make AMP versions of just about any web page. So let’s go ahead and get “Up and Running with AMP”!
